# Zweihander Character Generator
A simple, customizable character generator for ZWEIHANDER: Grim &amp; Perilous RPG.

This generator follows the same steps, in the same order, as the character creation process outlined in the ZWEIHANDER core book. Additionally, the odds for each character property should exactly match those listed in the book. Furthermore, it accounts for additional optional rules listed throughout the character creation chapter.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Select from the optional rule checkboxes
- If "Nonhuman" is CHECKED, the character's race will be randomly determined from the nonhuman races. If UNCHECKED, the character will be human. (default: UNCHECKED)
- If "Separate Alignment" is CHECKED, the character's Order and Chaos Alignments will come from different pairs. If UNCHECKED, the character's Alignments will be from the same pair. (default: UNCHECKED)
- If "Drawback" is CHECKED, the character will be generated with a Drawback. If UNCHECKED, the character will have no Drawback. (Default: CHECKED)
2. Select a Sex. If "No Preference" is chosen, the character's Height and Weight will be selected randomly from either the Male or Female table.
3. Generate the character!
4. Swap and/or Replace Attributes. Choose wisely: you only get to do it once!
