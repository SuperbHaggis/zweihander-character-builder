# Zweihander Character Generator
A simple, customizable character generator for ZWEIHANDER: Grim &amp; Perilous RPG.

This generator follows the same steps, in the same order, as the character creation process outlined in the ZWEIHANDER core book. Additionally, the odds for each character property should exactly match those listed in the relevant book. Furthermore, it accounts for additional optional rules listed throughout the character creation chapter.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Select from the optional rule checkboxes
- Select "Human" for a Human character. Select "Nonhuman" to generate a nonhuman, non-mutant character as per Revised Core Rulebook pg. 31. Select "Any" to choose from all possible Ancestries, including mutant Ancestries, as per PHB pg. 31. ("Human" checked by default)
- If "Separate Alignment" is CHECKED, the character's Order and Chaos Alignments will come from different pairs. If UNCHECKED, the character's Alignments will be from the same pair. (default: UNCHECKED)
- If "Drawback" is CHECKED, the character will be generated with a Drawback. If UNCHECKED, the character will have no Drawback. (Default: CHECKED)
2. Selection of the character's sex determines the Table from which their Height and Weight will be determined. This option has no bearing on the character's gender or any other character properties such as Distinguishing Marks. For a taller and heavier character, select "Male". For a shorter and lighter character, choose "Female". Choose "No Preference" to draw from all possible Heights and Weights. ("No Preference" checked by default)
3. Generate the character!
4. Swap and/or Replace Attributes. Choose wisely: you only get to do it once!
